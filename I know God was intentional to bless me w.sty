 I know God was intentional to bless me with one of His loveliest son. That's how intentional HE Loves me

 The love of God, and HIS Grace embedded!
 HIS Grace is our active Love before we met, while we got into courtship and forever in our marriage. Bestowing nothing less than Himself upon our relationship.
 This same grace saved us through faith - A priceless gift of God.





 It was the 10th of March, 2024—a Sunday like any other, or so I thought. After the service, I had just risen from my praying knees, ready to join the Mothering Day reception at church. It was a day dedicated to celebrating the women, and in a touching gesture, the men of the church served us. I decided to wait patiently for the last batch to get my meal, taking in the joyful atmosphere.

Finally, it was my turn, and as I collected my food and settled at a table with friends, I couldn’t help but glance around. That’s when I saw him—a tall, gentle man holding a plate of rice. He sat nearby, and I greeted him warmly. I recognized him as a friend of a friend, but I didn’t realize then that this brief meeting was the beginning of something far more meaningful.

Later that evening, curiosity got the best of me, and I reached out to a mutual friend for his contact. With genuine friendliness, I offered my assistance as a LinkedIn manager—a simple act that laid the foundation for what was to come. From that Sunday onward, our conversations became frequent and unexpectedly profound. God was speaking to me about him, yet it didn’t make sense to me then, and I prayed fervently to dismiss what I felt stirring.

But then, something changed. Month later, Oluwafemi asked me, quite directly, if I was praying about him. His words caught me off guard. “Praying for you or praying about you?” I replied, half-joking, trying to mask my surprise. He confidently responded that he believed I was praying for him, but humbly requested that I also pray about him. It was then that he revealed his intentions, laying bare what had been on his heart.

It was a moment of clarity for me. I had been content with the idea of friendship, and nothing more, but Oluwafemi’s sincerity made me realize it was time to surrender my own plans to God and allow myself to be vulnerable.

In Oluwafemi, I had found more than just a friend. I find a partner I feel confident and joyful walking down the aisle with—a man God had been intentional in bringing into my life. It is more proof to how deeply He loves me, gracing me with one of His loveliest sons. And that’s how our story began.
